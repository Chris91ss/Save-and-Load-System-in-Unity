EXAMPLE:


public class Player : MonoBehaviour, ISaveable    	// Note: you have to inherit from ISaveable
{

    public float playerHealth, playerMaxHealth;

    public object SaveState()		// Save the data
    {
        return new SaveData()
        {
            Health = playerHealth,
            maxHealth = playerMaxHealth
        };
    }

    public void LoadState(object state)		// Load the data
    {
        var saveData = (SaveData)state;
        playerHealth = saveData.Health;
        playerMaxHealth = saveData.maxHealth;
    }


    private struct SaveData		// make a struct with the data you want to save
    {
        public float Health;
        public float maxHealth;
    }
}
